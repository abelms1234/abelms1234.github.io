            <p> Hello and welcome! My name is Matt Abel. I am an honest and hardworking individual born in Hagerstown, Maryland, during the year of 1996. I moved to South Carolina in 2008, and I've been here ever since. I originally developed this website for my HTML5 and CSS3 class at the University of South Carolina Beaufort, however, it also serves as my personal online resume as well as a visual representation of what I learned in my first year of college. </p>
            <p> My main interests are in the fields of computers and programming. The reason I chose this path is because of the rise of demand in programmers and because I am interested in the different applications of computer science. I plan to use my education and experience to build an understanding of computer programming and web development in the pursuit of a career in technology. My goal is to be able to help develop and maintain a business website and any networks a business may utilize. If you are seeking any information about me or my accomplishments, I have done my best to provide the answers to any questions here on my site. </p>
