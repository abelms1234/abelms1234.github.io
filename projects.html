        <h2> HTML5 and CSS3 Final Project: Web Based Resume</h2>
        <p> This website is the only project I have really made thus far in my college career, but it is already an invaluable asset. Using what I had learned from the course, we were instructed to develop a "scratch" made website that would have the same layout as a typical resume. This website was made to have different working links to sections that roughly correspond to the different sections of a resume. </p>
        <p> My website resume is a visual representation of the skills that I had developed over the course of the HTML5 and CSS3 class. Here is a good example of my major being applied in an actual, usable form, that companies will be able to actually see instead of just reading a test score, which doesn't always prove someone's abilities. The work I have done on this site will be used beyond just this project. I will use this website and improve upon it as I become more accomplished and gain more experience. It will be a mark of my skill and will always be available to potential employers. </p>
