    <h2>Work Experience </h2>
    <p> The experience I've gained from being out on a job. All of the work experience I have is in local flooring businesses, one of which has recently become a permanent employer for my father and I. </p>

        <h1> My Work Experience </h1>
        <h2>Variety Floor Covering</h2>
        <img src="varietyfloors.JPG" alt="Variety Floor Covering" >
        <p> I have been to many installations for the different flooring companies of Hilton Head Island with my father, Matt Abel. Eventually, we settled for Variety Floor Covering, where he is now the manager. I have two years of work doing installations under my belt. I've done both major and minor installations for homes and companies, from the Hilton Head Blooms retirement homes to the Wexford luxury homes on Hilton Head Island, and many more. I learned many tricks of the trade and have helped to install an assortment of flooring from hardwood floors to soft carpets. Flooring is a laborious task though, very exhausting. </p>
        <p> The reason my father quit installing and switched to management is due to the toll that it takes on your body, especially the knees, although we do still have some small installations that come and go. One thing is for sure, flooring installation is one job that has taught me the true meaning and value of hard work. It is an experience that I will take with me wherever my career may lead. </p>
