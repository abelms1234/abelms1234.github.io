        <h1> My Education</h1>
        <h2>Hilton Head Island High School</h2>
        <p> I graduated from HiltonHead Island High School in 2014, under the Duke TIP program for talented students.  This is where I began to learn the basics of programing. I took courses such as Programming and C++ basics. I had also painted two murals for HHI high school during my drawing classes. </p>
        <h2>University of South Carolina Beaufort</h2>
        <p> This is my current school, where I am a freshmen. The courses I've taken include HTML5 and CSS3, Computer Concepts, as well as a few general credit courses. </p>
        <h3>Major</h3>
        <p> My major is Computational Science, which is an applied computer science for solving a particular problem. I chose this major because of the rise in computer related technology and I understand that the roll of computers in business will only grow as the years go by. I Find myself enjoying computer work, it also isn't as physically draining as some of the other jobs I have done in the past.</p>
